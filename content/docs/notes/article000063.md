## Intro
Understanding the data protection laws


## EU


#### GDPR - (Digital Operational Resilience Act)

Applies to everyone processing EU/EEA data: Even if a business is not based in the EU, if it offers goods or services to, or monitors the behavior of, individuals in the EU/EEA, the GDPR applies.
Definition of Personal Data: Broadly defines personal data as any information that can directly or indirectly identify a living person (e.g., name, address, IP address, online identifiers, health data).
Core Principles (Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency):

 - **Lawfulness**: Data processing must have a legitimate basis (e.g., consent, contract necessity, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, legitimate interest).
 - **Fairness**: Data must be processed in a way that respects the individual's rights.
 - **Transparency**: Individuals must be informed about how their data is being used in a clear and understandable manner.


#### DORA - (Digital Operational Resilience Act)
The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is an European Union regulation designed to strengthen the digital operational resilience of the financial sector. It entered into force on January 16, 2023, and will apply as of January 17, 2025.


Key aspects of DORA:

Sector-Specific: Unlike the broad data protection scope of GDPR, DORA is specifically aimed at the financial sector, including banks, insurance companies, investment firms, payment institutions, electronic money institutions, crypto-asset service providers, and their critical ICT third-party service providers (like cloud providers).

- Focus on Resilience: DORA's primary goal is to ensure that financial entities can withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT (Information and Communication Technology) disruptions, such as cyberattacks, system failures, and other operational incidents.

- **Five Pillars**: It establishes uniform requirements across five key areas:
    - **ICT Risk Management**: Comprehensive framework for managing ICT risks.
ICT-related Incident Management, Classification, and Reporting: Procedures for detecting, managing, and reporting major ICT-related incidents to competent authorities.
    - **Digital Operational Resilience Testing**: Regular testing of ICT systems, including advanced threat-led penetration testing for larger entities.
    - **ICT Third-Party Risk Management**: Managing risks associated with reliance on third-party ICT service providers, including contractual provisions and oversight.
    - **Information Sharing**: Framework for sharing information and intelligence on cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
    - Harmonization: DORA aims to harmonize existing national rules on operational resilience within the EU financial sector, reducing fragmentation and ensuring a consistent approach.
    - Direct Applicability: As an EU Regulation, DORA is directly applicable in all EU member states from its effective date, without needing national transposition.


## Germany

For businesses in Germany, the following regulations are relevant:

 - GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
 - DSGVO (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung)
Both terms refer to the same law, namely Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).


The "DSGVO" (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung) is simply the German abbreviation for the **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**. Therefore, the core principles of the DSGVO are exactly the same as those of the GDPR.

As outlined in Article 5 of the GDPR, these seven principles are:

1.  **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:**
    * **Lawfulness:** Processing must have a valid legal basis.
    * **Fairness:** Processing must be done in a way that is fair to the individual.
    * **Transparency:** Individuals must be clearly informed about how their data is processed.

2.  **Purpose Limitation:**
    * Data must be collected for **specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes** and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.

3.  **Data Minimization:**
    * Data collected must be **adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary** for the processing purpose.

4.  **Accuracy:**
    * Personal data must be **accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date**. Inaccurate data must be corrected or erased without delay.

5.  **Storage Limitation:**
    * Data must be kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for **no longer than is necessary** for the purposes for which it's processed.

6.  **Integrity and Confidentiality (Security):**
    * Data must be processed in a manner that ensures **appropriate security**, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. This requires technical and organizational measures.

7.  **Accountability:**
    * The **data controller** is responsible for, and must be able to **demonstrate compliance** with, all the other principles.



## USA

CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)
The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) is a landmark data privacy law in the United States, specifically for California residents. It came into full effect on January 1, 2023, with enforcement beginning in February 2024.

CPRA vs. GDPR: While the CPRA is often called the "GDPR of California" due to its comprehensive nature, there are key differences:

**Geographical Scope**: GDPR applies to the EU/EEA, while CPRA is specific to California.
Legal Basis for Processing: GDPR generally requires a legal basis (like consent or legitimate interest) for all data processing. CPRA is more focused on giving consumers the right to opt-out of certain uses (like sale/sharing) after data is collected, though explicit consent is needed for certain sensitive data or for minors.

**Penalties**: GDPR has higher potential fines (up to â‚¬20 million or 4% of global annual turnover), whereas CPRA fines are generally lower and target violations involving individuals.
